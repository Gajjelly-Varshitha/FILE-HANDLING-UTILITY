##DESCRIPTION

I complied this program in Visual Studio Code platform. The main objective of this program is to create a Java application that performs three primary file operations: writing data to a file, reading data from a file, and modifying the contents of an existing file. These operations are commonly used in real-world applications such as logging systems, data storage applications, configuration management, and report generation.

In this program, the FileHandlingUtility class is designed with separate methods for each file operation, ensuring modularity and code reusability. The writeFile() method is responsible for creating a text file and writing content into it. This method uses the FileWriter and BufferedWriter classes. FileWriter establishes a connection between the Java program and the file, while BufferedWriter improves efficiency by buffering the data before writing it to the file. When this method is executed, it either creates a new file or overwrites an existing file with the specified content.

The readFile() method demonstrates how to read data from a text file. It utilizes the FileReader and BufferedReader classes. FileReader reads characters from the file, and BufferedReader allows the program to read the file line by line. This approach is efficient and suitable for handling large text files. The content read from the file is displayed on the console, enabling the user to verify the stored data easily.

The modifyFile() method illustrates how to modify existing file content without deleting previous data. This method appends new text to the file by using FileWriter in append mode. Appending is particularly useful in applications such as maintaining logs or adding new records to a file. The method also ensures that a new line is added before inserting additional content, maintaining the readability of the file.
